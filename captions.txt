Can you pick up the groceries? I haven't botany
I'm rooting for you
Plant a kiss on me
You grow gurl
Plants always leaf me wanting more
I like big plants and I cannot lie
Plant dreams, pull weeds, and grow a happy life :)
Sometimes, I wet my plants
Wherever life plants you, bloom with grace
Friend: Do you want to go out tonight? \n\n Me: I can't make it. I'm busy tonight (staying home with my plants).
Meet my new best bud.
I be-leaf in you
Grow short--it's your birthday
Don't stop beleafing
If you need me, I'll be in the garden
The best things in life are green
Root, root, root for the home green
"Like people, plants respond to extra attention." – H. Peter Loewer
"We plant seeds that will flower as results in our lives, so best to remove the weeds of anger, avarice, envy and doubt, that peace and abundance may manifest for all." – Dorothy Day
"What we shall plant in the soil of contemplation, we shall reap in the harvest of action." – Meister Eckhart
Never be afraid to be called a plant lady
Plant one on me. Or 2 or 3.
The closest I am to being a parent is taking care of all of my plants
"You're only here for a short visit. Don't hurry, don't worry. And be sure to smell the flowers along the way." — Walter Hagen
